Flappy EthOS Game
Welcome to Flappy EthOS, a fun and challenging game inspired by the classic Flappy Bird, but with a unique Ethereum twist! ðŸš€

Game Overview
Flappy EthOS is designed to test your reflexes as you guide your bird through a world filled with crypto-themed obstacles. It's a playful tribute to the Ethereum ecosystem, complete with dynamic difficulty that adapts as you play!

Features
Ethereum Theme: Immerse yourself in a blockchain-inspired world.

Candlestick Obstacles: Navigate through red and green candlestick pillars, just like real crypto charts!

Crypto-Themed Messages: Get a laugh with unique game-over messages like "You're rugged!" or "Gas fees were too high."

Dynamic Difficulty: The game starts easy, but as you progress, the gravity and pipe speed gradually increase, keeping you on your toes.
